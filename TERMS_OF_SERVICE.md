## Terms of Service

These Terms govern your access to and use of the products and services we provide through or for r/IGCSE Bot (referred to hereafter as “Services”).

These Terms also govern users’ use of our Services. Please note that Discord has their own terms of service, which can be found here: https://discord.com/terms

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services as stated in the Terms, and the Agreement will apply to any changes.

## 1. Who’s Who

“You” means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using our Services you’re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.

## 2. Your Account

Using our Services requires a Discord account. You agree that we may collect your data as listed in our privacy policy. We may send you messages about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response. Your best option to keep up-to-date with this information is to join our official Discord server and follow our announcements channel.

You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions. If you get fired because of a story you write about your boss, that’s on you.

## 3. Minimum Age Requirements

Our Services are not directed to children. You’re not allowed to access or use our Services if you’re under the age of 13 (as doing so is a violation of Discord's Terms of Service). If you use our Services, you represent that you’re at least 13. You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you’re under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.

## 4. Responsibility of Visitors and Users

We haven’t reviewed, and can’t review, all of the content posted to or made available through our Services by users or anyone else (“Content”) or on websites that link to, or are linked from, our Services. We’re not responsible for any use or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:

-   We don’t have any control over third-party websites.
-   A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any third-party website.
-   We don’t endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.
-   You’re fully responsible for the Content that you produce using this bot and any harm resulting from that Content. It’s your responsibility to ensure that your server's Content abides by applicable laws and by the Agreement.
-   We aren’t responsible for any harm resulting from anyone’s access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-party websites. You’re responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
-   We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.

## 5. Fees and Payment

We do not collect any fees or payments. All our services are available for free.

## 6. Feedback

We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we’re free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.
